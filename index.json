            "content": "On my desktop at home I am running Windows 10 Pro, but i really like to play around with Linux distributions, because I think it is important to know these OS's as a developer. Therefore I have installed \u0026ldquo;Windows Subsystem for Linux\u0026rdquo; also known as WLS. This is a compatibility layer for running Linux executables (ELF format) on Windows 10.\nI always tend to forget how to keep the Linux environment up to date, with the newest version of my different tools, because I am running mostly on Windows. Therefore here is a little guide on how to keep your .NetCore SDK up to date.\nRegister Microsoft key and feed Before installing .Net Core, you'll need to register the Microsoft key, register the product repository, and install required dependencies. This only needs to be done once per machine.\nOpen a terminal and run the following commands: wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb\nInstall the .NET SDK In your terminal, run the following commands: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-3.0\nAnd viola. Now verify that you have the newest version of .Net Core 3 by typing the following in the terminal:\ndotnet --info Now you are ready to go program with the new awesome .Net Core 3\n",

            "content": "My name is Michael and I am a software developer, which I truely love.\nIn June 2013 I finished as a ICT engineer (Information and Communication Technology), which is the same as an IT-engineer.\nWhen i first started and was brand new to the world of programming, I often needed help, which I often found on diffrent blogs where other tech interested people had wrote about what they had code at home or at work. This I found really helpfull, and I have every since learned a lot from reading different tech blogs.\nTherefore I decided to create this blog, both so I had a place to store everything that I had done, because I tend to forget after a while, but also to help out others to get insprred.\nI love to play around with new technologies and I am really interested in it-architecture, and therefore I will try to put my self out there and document what I am doing.\nHopefully you will find it interesting, and don't hold back on commenting on my different post. In that way I might also learn a bit or correct some errors that I have introduced :)\n",
