      <description>On my desktop at home I am running Windows 10 Pro, but i really like to play around with Linux distributions, because I think it is important to know these OS&#39;s as a developer. Therefore I have installed &amp;ldquo;Windows Subsystem for Linux&amp;rdquo; also known as WLS. This is a compatibility layer for running Linux executables (ELF format) on Windows 10.
I always tend to forget how to keep the Linux environment up to date, with the newest version of my different tools, because I am running mostly on Windows.</description>

      <description>My name is Michael and I am a software developer, which I truely love.
In June 2013 I finished as a ICT engineer (Information and Communication Technology), which is the same as an IT-engineer.
When i first started and was brand new to the world of programming, I often needed help, which I often found on diffrent blogs where other tech interested people had wrote about what they had code at home or at work.</description>
