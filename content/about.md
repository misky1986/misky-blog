My name is Michael and I am a software developer, which I truely love. 

In June 2013 I finished as a ICT engineer (Information and Communication Technology), which is the same as an IT-engineer.

When i first started and was brand new to the world of programming, I often needed help, which I often found on diffrent blogs where other tech interested people had wrote about what they had code at home or at work. This I found really helpfull, and I have every since learned a lot from reading different tech blogs.

Therefore I decided to create this blog, both so I had a place to store everything that I had done, because I tend to forget after a while, but also to help out others to get insprred.

I love to play around with new technologies and I am really interested in it-architecture, and therefore I will try to put my self out there and document what I am doing.

Hopefully you will find it interesting, and don't hold back on commenting on my different post. In that way I might also learn a bit or correct some errors that I have introduced :)
