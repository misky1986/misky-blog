My name is Michael and I am a software developer, which I truely love. 

In June 2013 I finished as a ICT engineer (Information and Communication Technology), which is the same as an IT-engineer.

When i first started and was brand new to the world of technology, I often needed help, which I often found on diffrent blogs where other tech interested people had wrote about what they were doing. This I really found helpfull, and I have learn alot from that.

Therefore i decided to create this blog, both so I had a place where everything I had done was document, because I tend to forget, but also to help out others.

I love to play around with new technologies and I am really interested in it-architecture, and therefore I will try to put my self out there and document what I am doing.

Hopefully you will find it interesting, and don't hold back commenting on my different post. I that way I might also learn a bit or correct some errors that I have introduced.
